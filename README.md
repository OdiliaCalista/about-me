# about-me

Hi, I'm an undergraduate student at Universitas Negeri Yogyakarta.

I'm currently learning the fundamentals of programming, version control with Git, and basic software development workflows. I use GitHub to store learning projects, practice coding, and explore open-source repositories.

This profile is part of my learning journey as a student.
